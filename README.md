This report is concerned with the potential effects of personal and professional experience on the
average salary received by full-time employees within tech companies in the US. We used Stack
Overflow Developer Survey Results (2019) to build a linear regression model to identify the
most influential factors. We found out that having a graduate degree has the highest impact on
salary, along with other strong predictors . The linear regression model we build could provide
insights to seasoned developers, job-seekers, and employers, regarding potential salary
redistribution, job satisfaction, and work environment.
